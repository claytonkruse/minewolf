<h1>About <span>Minewolf</span></h1>
<p>
    Minewolf is a Minecraft server list. Why did I make another Minecraft server
    list in a vast, unrelenting sea of server lists? Because I could do it
    better.
</p>
<p>
    Rather than having server owners manually enter things like the server
    version, and plugins, these things are tracked automatically. Not only does
    this save time for the server owners, it will allow players to more easily
    find servers they're interested in. Server information will be constantly up
    to date.
</p>
<p>
    The con that comes with this automatic style of server listing, is that many
    tags cannot be added manually. Proxy servers will not show the plugins of
    their subservers, unless programmed specifcally to do so. I am content with
    this. I would like to be the creator of a server list that favors smaller,
    non-proxied servers anyway.
</p>
<p>
    I also plan for Minewolf to be at least a <em>little</em> inovative, like
    all developers with delusions of of grandeur. So far I've got:
    <em>revenue sharing</em>.
</p>
<p>
    With revenue sharing, server owners would get a portion of the ad revenue
    from votes, and maybe even from their server page in the case that they can
    find a reason to send people there
    <em>frequently</em>
    enough. Revenue sharing will be difficult to do, so I'm planning on adding it
    late in the game,
    <em>if it happens at all.</em>
</p>
<p>
    A real optimistic idea I'm having is that I could somehow integrate
    donations and even become the next Buycraft, though I doubt that's
    happening.

<p>Your developer,<br /><strong><em>Hiemswolf</em></strong></p>

<p>Add free subdomain functionality.</p>

<p>Idea for revenue sharing:</p>
<p>1 vote = 8w</p>
<p>
    wuf or w is a currecy that is paid to server owners through votes, but it
    may also be bought with cash
</p>
<p>Featured Server system:</p>
<p>Auction has a small entrance fee.</p>
<p>No 1 winner gets half the total jackpot created by the entarence fees.</p>
<p>
    Auction has 8 sponsored slots, but only three slots appear on the front
    page.
</p>

<p>Votes are worth half in the rankings after 8 days and deleted after 16.</p>

<p>Players can vote for as many servers as they want in one day.</p>
