<h1>Server Owner Dashboard</h1>

<section>
	<h2>Your Servers</h2>
</section>

<p>Idea for revenue sharing:</p>
<p>1 vote = 8w</p>
<p>
	wuf or w is a currecy that is paid to server owners through votes, but it may also be bought with
	cash
</p>
<p>Featured Server system:</p>
<p>Auction has a small entrance fee.</p>
<p>No 1 winner gets half the total jackpot created by the entarence fees.</p>
<p>Auction has 8 sponsored slots, but only three slots appear on the front page.</p>

<p>Votes are worth half in the rankings after 8 days and deleted after 16.</p>

<p>Players can vote for as many servers as they want in one day.</p>
